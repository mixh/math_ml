- Not sure if code is correct

TODO 
- Discussion Part still not done 

  i.	Based on the weights of the linear regression model, rank the features (note: only continuous features) in decreasing order of influence on the predictions. 

  ii.	Discuss how the influence of the features (obtained in question e.1) relates to the pair-wise correlation results calculated above i.e., are the features that are highly correlated with the output also the most     influential or is there some other phenomenon being observed?

  iii.	Comment about the MAPE, RMSE, R2 results. What can we learn from each of these results about the model prediction performance?

  iv.	Why is centering and scaling the data important before performing PCA?
